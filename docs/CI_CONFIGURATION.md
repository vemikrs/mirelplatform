# CI Configuration Guide for Full E2E Test Execution

## Current Status - ENABLED ✅

The E2E testing infrastructure is complete and **fully functional in both local and CI environments**.

Full E2E test execution has been **enabled in GitHub Actions** after network access configuration.

## Network Configuration - COMPLETED ✅

Network access has been configured for:
- ✅ `api.foojay.io` - Required for Gradle/Java toolchain
- ✅ `esm.ubuntu.com` - Required for apt package manager

## Current CI Workflow - ACTIVE

The workflow runs the following jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  validate-setup:
    - Setup Node.js 20
    - Install E2E dependencies (npm ci)
    - Validate setup (npm run test:e2e:validate)
    - List test specifications
  
  e2e-tests:
    - Build backend with Gradle
    - Start backend and frontend services
    - Install Playwright browsers
    - Run E2E tests on Chromium
    - Upload test results and screenshots
  
  accessibility-audit:
    - Build backend with Gradle
    - Start backend and frontend services
    - Run accessibility-specific tests
    - Upload accessibility audit results
```

## Test Execution

### CI Environment - Fully Enabled ✅
All E2E tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:
- Chromium browser tests
- Accessibility audits
- Visual regression tests
- Workflow validation tests

### Local Development - Fully Functional ✅
No configuration needed - all features work immediately:

```bash
# Validate setup
npm run test:e2e:validate

# Start services
./scripts/start-services.sh

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e                # Headless mode
npm run test:e2e:headed         # With browser visible
npm run test:e2e:ui             # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:debug          # Debug mode

# Custom script
./scripts/e2e/run-tests.sh -b chromium -h
```

## Test Infrastructure Components

All components are implemented and running:

- ✅ **47+ Test Specifications**
  - Basic functionality tests
  - Complete workflow tests
  - Accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Visual regression tests
  - UI enhancement validation

- ✅ **Page Object Model**
  - Base page class
  - ProMarker page object
  - Reusable utilities

- ✅ **Test Data**
  - Real stencil configurations
  - Validation test cases
  - Fixtures and helpers

- ✅ **CI/CD Integration**
  - Automated service startup
  - Multi-job workflow
  - Artifact collection
  - Failure reporting

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Checking CI Status
1. Go to the Actions tab in the repository
2. View recent workflow runs
3. Review test results and artifacts
4. Check for any failures or flaky tests

### Reviewing Test Results
- Test results are uploaded as artifacts
- Screenshots available for failed tests
- HTML reports generated for each run
- Accessibility audit reports included

### Adding More Browsers
To test on Firefox and WebKit in addition to Chromium, update the matrix in `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
```

## Reference Files

- **Active Workflow**: `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` (enabled with full jobs)
- **Documentation**: `docs/E2E_TESTING.md` (complete testing guide)
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts` (Playwright settings)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/e2e/run-tests.sh` (local execution helper)

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Review `docs/E2E_TESTING.md` for detailed documentation
2. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
3. Run validation locally: `npm run test:e2e:validate`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements now that full CI execution is enabled:
- ✅ Complete browser matrix (Chromium currently, can add Firefox/WebKit)
- Visual regression baseline management
- Performance testing integration
- Parallel test execution optimization
- Extended timeout for complex scenarios
